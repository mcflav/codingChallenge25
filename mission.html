     <h1>Our Mission</h1>
     <h2>Experienced Service, Always</h2>

     <p>Our experience allows us to do a great job, every time. We have been serving the Jacksonville, FL 
     area for over 15 years and take pride in the services we provide. Experience is one of our biggest
     selling points. Everyone we hire is specially trained in lawn maintenance, and also has skills in
     landscaping and gardening. With our experience combined, we create a formidable team that can
     handle anything you throw our way. It’s our pleasure to share our knowledge with you and to help 
     you create a lawn that not only looks beautiful but is one you and your neighborhood can be proud of.</p>
     
     <h2>A Variety of Landscape Services</h2>
     
     <p>We do more than just groom your lawn. We make it healthy again, and can even plant you a new lawn
     should you want that. Take a look at our website to see all of the services we offer. Feel free
     to ask if there’s something not on the list that you would like to inquire about. One of our friendly
     and dedicated customer service representatives will be more than happy to tell you what we can do
     for you.</p>
     
     <h2>Quality Products</h2>
     
     <p>All products we use are of only the highest quality. We don’t use anything on your lawn that we wouldn’t
     use on ours. This means our price is well worth it. Not only do we guarantee to take care of your lawn 
     and leave it looking like new, but it will also be healthy and ready to be enjoyed by the whole family.
     No harmful chemicals or pesticides that would make your pets or kids sick. Our products do more than make
     your lawn beautiful right now. They give it longevity and a sheen that will last for weeks. From grass to
     flowers to shrubbery, we’ve got everything taken care of – now and down the road.</p>
     
     <h2>Fair Prices</h2>
     
     <p>Even with our experience, know-how, and quality products, we always make sure to offer fair prices that are
     competitive with other lawn services in the area. We know that by offering a good price we can attract not 
     only new business but keep the legendary clients as well.Every so often we will run special sales and deals
     just in case money is tight or you’re still debating whether or not to try our service. These specials can
     come and go pretty quickly, so we recommend that you bookmark our website. While we do have various packages
     and a-la carte services, don’t be shy to ask if we can do something not listed on our site. Also, when you 
     contact us, we will be more than happy to give you a free quote to help you decide whether or not it’s the
     right time to use our services.</p>
